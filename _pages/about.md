I am an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the ISG Business and Economics School in Lisbon. I completed my undergraduate studies and my first master's degree in Mathematical Physics at Moscow State University. Subsequently, I earned another master's degree in Mathematics from the University of Lisbon. 

Currently, I am affiliated as a researcher with CENTRA (Center of Astrophysics and Gravitation), a research unit of the University of Lisbon, where I also received my PhD. My research interests are primarily focused on stellar structure and evolution. Specifically, I am interested in exploring how the thermodynamics of stellar interiors can influence the observed properties of low-mass stars, utilizing asteroseismology as a tool to probe these interiors.
